# MXPhysics

MXPhysics is an Objective-C wrapper around Box2D.

## Requirements
- Objective-C, Xcode 8

## Installation

#### With [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods)

```
use_frameworks!
pod 'MXPhysics', :git => 'https://github.com/cliftonr/MXPhysics.git'
```

## Overview

Though the underlying Box2D functionality is unchanged, `MXPhysics` attempts to improve the interface for 
system-component based architectures by reducing the apparent coupling between objects.

- Worlds, bodies and fixtures may be created independently of one another.
- Fixtures may be associated with bodies, and bodies may be associated with worlds after they are initialized.
- At any time, fixtures may be removed from bodies, and bodies may be removed from worlds.
    - However, fixtures and bodies may not *yet* be added during a time-step.
- Collisions are handled via a delegate object conforming to `MXContactListenerDelegate`.
- Length is measured in points rather than Box2D meters. Angles are in degrees, rather than Box2D radians.
Mass is still measured in kilograms.
